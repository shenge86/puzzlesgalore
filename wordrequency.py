# Python's efficient key/value hash table structure is called a "dict". 
# The dict (dictionary) class object in Python is a very versatile and useful container type, able to store a collection of values and retrieve them via keys.
# The values can be objects of any type (dictionaries can even be nested with other dictionaries) and the keys can be any object so long as it's hashable, 
# meaning basically that it is immutable (so strings are not the only valid keys, but mutable objects like lists can never be used as keys). 
# The contents of a dict can be written as a series of key:value pairs within braces { }, e.g. dict = {key1:value1, key2:value2, ... }. 
# The "empty dict" is just an empty pair of curly braces {}.
